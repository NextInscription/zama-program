  - `ethers` - Ethereum library for blockchain interactions
  - `@web3modal/ethers` - Web3Modal for wallet connections
  - `valtio` - State management library
  - `@zama-fhe/relayer-sdk` - Zama FHE encryption/decryption SDK

#### 2. Configuration & Setup ✅
- ✅ Created Web3Modal configuration (`src/config/web3modal.ts`)
  - Configured Sepolia testnet

  - Responsive design for all screen sizes

#### 5. Deposit Functionality ✅
- ✅ Created Deposit component (`src/components/Deposit.vue`)
  - **Type 1 - Specified Recipient**: Only designated address can withdraw
  - **Type 2 - Anyone with Password**: Anyone with password can withdraw (uses blackhole address)
  - **Type 3 - Entrusted Withdrawal**: Trustee withdraws for recipient
  - Implemented FHE encryption for:
    - Password (converted from string to uint256 via keccak256)
    - Transfer type
    - Password address (derived from password)
    - Allow address (recipient or blackhole)
  - Combined input proofs for single transaction
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Success/error message display

#### 6. Withdrawal Functionality ✅
- ✅ Created Withdraw component (`src/components/Withdraw.vue`)
  - Password input to derive private key
  - Load vault information using `getVault` ABI function
  - Decrypt vault data using Zama FHE relayer SDK:
    - Transfer type
    - Balance
    - Depositor address
    - Allowed address
    - Password address
  - Display vault information in user-friendly format
  - Amount input with max balance validation
  - Execute withdrawal with encrypted parameters
  - Success/error feedback

#### 7. Bounty List & Entrust Withdraw ✅
- ✅ Created BountyList component (`src/components/BountyList.vue`)
  - Fetch all tasks using `getPasswords` ABI function
  - Get fee commission rate from contract
  - Calculate commission: `(amount * fee / 1000) * 100`
  - Display tasks in grid layout with:
    - Task amount
    - Commission reward
    - Total reward
  - Task selection modal
  - Implement `entrustWithdraw` functionality
  - Password verification
  - Transaction execution and confirmation
  - Automatic refresh after successful withdrawal

### Technical Implementation Details

#### FHE Encryption Flow
1. User inputs plaintext password
2. Convert password to uint256: `BigInt(keccak256(Buffer.from(password)))`
3. Derive wallet from password hash
4. Initialize Zama FHE instance with:
   - Chain ID (Sepolia: 11155111)
   - Public key from gateway
   - Gateway URL: https://gateway.sepolia.zama.ai
5. Encrypt each parameter separately
6. Combine input proofs
7. Submit transaction with encrypted handles and proofs

#### State Management
- Used valtio for reactive state management
- Wallet state syncs automatically with Web3Modal
- Contract instance auto-updates on connection change

#### Contract Address
- Sepolia: `0x8ea2dDD9DD550d500B4cef4C560fE27cde37508D`

### Known Issues & Notes
1. **WalletConnect Project ID**: Need to replace 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID' in `web3modal.ts` with actual WalletConnect project ID
2. **FHE Public Key**: Current implementation fetches from gateway - verify endpoint is correct
3. **TypeScript**: Some diagnostics warnings about missing component declarations - these will resolve after build
4. **Testing**: All features need testing on Sepolia testnet with actual wallet
5. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling implemented - may need enhancement for production

### API Updates & Fixes ✅
**Date: 2025-10-23 (Later)**

Fixed TypeScript errors and updated to use correct @zama-fhe/relayer-sdk API:

1. **Changed import path** from `@zama-fhe/relayer-sdk` to `@zama-fhe/relayer-sdk/web` for browser compatibility
2. **Used SepoliaConfig** instead of manual configuration for FHE instance
3. **API method corrections**:
   - Changed `addU256()` to `add256()`
   - Changed `addAddress()` (kept same)
   - Updated encrypt() return type to `{ handles: Uint8Array[], inputProof: Uint8Array }`
4. **Hex conversion**: Used `hexlify()` from ethers to convert Uint8Array to hex strings
5. **Simplified encryption**: Combined multiple parameters into single encrypted input
6. **Decryption**: Used `publicDecrypt()` for reading vault information
7. **Removed unused functions**: Cleaned up getPublicKey() stubs

### Runtime Fix - Valtio Integration ✅
**Issue**: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useMemo')` error in browser

**Root Cause**: `useSnapshot` from valtio is React-specific and doesn't work with Vue

**Solution**: Use valtio proxy objects directly in Vue without `useSnapshot`
- Valtio proxy objects are already reactive in Vue
- Removed `useSnapshot` imports from all components
- Changed `const wallet = useSnapshot(walletState)` to `const wallet = walletState`

### UX Improvement - Auto-Generated Private Keys ✅
**Date: 2025-10-23**

**Change**: Modified deposit flow to auto-generate private keys instead of user input

**Implementation**:
1. **Removed password input field** - Users no longer enter passwords
2. **Auto-generate random wallet** - Uses `Wallet.createRandom()` when user clicks deposit
3. **Confirmation modal** - Shows before transaction with:
   - Warning message about saving the key
   - Private key display with copy button
   - Withdrawal address display
   - Checkbox confirmation that user has backed up the key
4. **Mandatory backup confirmation** - Cannot proceed with deposit until checkbox is checked

**Benefits**:
- Better security - randomly generated keys are more secure than user passwords
- Better UX - users don't need to think of passwords
- Clear backup flow - explicit warning that key cannot be recovered

### Build Status ✅
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Vite build completed (~14s)
- ✅ All type errors resolved
- ✅ Runtime valtio error fixed
- ✅ Wallet connection working correctly
- ✅ Auto-generated private key flow implemented
- ⚠️ Large bundle size (2.5MB) - mainly due to FHE WASM modules (expected)

### SDK Initialization & WASM Module Fix ✅
**Date: 2025-10-23 (Latest)**

**Issue 1**: Runtime error "Impossible to fetch public key: wrong relayer url"
**Issue 2**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '__wbindgen_malloc')" - WASM not initialized

**Root Cause**:
1. WASM modules need to be initialized via `initSDK()` before calling `createInstance()`
2. Creating FHE instances inside component functions is inefficient and error-prone

**Solution**: Proper SDK initialization flow
1. **Added `initSDK()` call in `src/main.ts`** - Initialize WASM modules before mounting app
2. **Moved `createInstance()` to top-level** in all components - Create shared FHE instance once
3. **Updated config** to include both `relayerUrl` and `gatewayUrl`

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// main.ts - Initialize SDK before app mount
import { initSDK } from '@zama-fhe/relayer-sdk/web'

await initSDK()
createApp(App).mount('#app')

// Components - Create shared instance at top level
const fheInstance = await createInstance(SepoliaConfig)
```

**Configuration** (src/config/fheConfig.ts):
```typescript
export const SEPOLIA_FHE_CONFIG = {
  aclContractAddress: '0x687820221192C5B662b25367F70076A37bc79b6c',
  kmsContractAddress: '0x1364cBBf2cDF5032C47d8226a6f6FBD2AFCDacAC',
  inputVerifierContractAddress: '0xbc91f3daD1A5F19F8390c400196e58073B6a0BC4',
  verifyingContractAddressDecryption: '0xb6E160B1ff80D67Bfe90A85eE06Ce0A2613607D1',
  verifyingContractAddressInputVerification: '0x7048C39f048125eDa9d678AEbaDfB22F7900a29F',
  chainId: 11155111,
  gatewayChainId: 55815,
  network: 'https://1rpc.io/sepolia',
  relayerUrl: 'https://relayer.testnet.zama.cloud',
  gatewayUrl: 'https://gateway.sepolia.zama.ai/'
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ WASM modules properly initialized before use
- ✅ Single shared FHE instance per component (performance)
- ✅ Cleaner code structure with top-level async setup
- ✅ Both relayer and gateway URLs configured

### WASM Loading Fix ✅
**Date: 2025-10-23 (Final)**

**Issue**: "WebAssembly.instantiate(): expected magic word 00 61 73 6d, found 3c 21 64 6f"

**Root Cause**: WASM files weren't being served correctly by Vite - returning HTML instead of binary

**Solution**:
1. **Copied WASM files to `/public/wasm/`** directory
2. **Updated `initSDK()` to load from public path**:
   ```typescript
   initSDK({
     tfheParams: '/wasm/tfhe_bg.wasm',
     kmsParams: '/wasm/kms_lib_bg.wasm',
   })
   ```
3. **Added required headers** to vite.config.ts:
   - `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
   - `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`

**Status**: ✅ SDK initialization working, WASM modules loading correctly

### Current Status - Relayer Connection Issue ⚠️

**Current Error**:
```
Relayer didn't response correctly. Bad status. Content: {
  "message": "Transaction rejected: Input request failed: Transaction failed:
  Failed to check contract code: backend connection task has stopped"
}
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ FHE SDK initialization successful
- ✅ WASM modules loading correctly
- ✅ Encryption working properly
- ✅ Contract exists on Sepolia (0x8ea2dDD9DD550d500B4cef4C560fE27cde37508D)
- ❌ Zama relayer cannot verify/connect to contract

**Possible Causes**:
1. Zama testnet relayer service temporarily down or experiencing issues
2. Contract needs additional configuration/verification for FHEVM
3. Relayer rate limiting
4. Contract deployment method incompatible with relayer expectations

**Next Steps for Production
- [ ] Obtain and configure WalletConnect Project ID from WalletConnect Cloud
- [ ] Test all three deposit types on Sepolia testnet
- [ ] Test withdrawal with different transfer types
- [ ] Test bounty task completion
- [ ] Verify FHE encryption/decryption flow works correctly
- [ ] Add loading states and better UX feedback
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add transaction history tracking
- [ ] Consider code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
- [ ] Add analytics/tracking (optional)
- [ ] Security audit before mainnet deployment
- [ ] Performance optimization
